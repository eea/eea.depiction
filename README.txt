EEA Depiction
=============
`EEA Depiction`_ (formerly valentine.imagescales) is a generic system for
creating thumbnails/image representations for content types,
both those provided by Plone, and custom ones. To make it work for a content
type, three adapters need to be provided:

1. ImageView that retrieves an image in the desired scale.
2. ImageTag that returns the HTML tag for the image
3. ImageLink that returns the HTML link to the image.


Upgrade notes
=============

As of **eea.depiction 5.2** we customize the following resources in order to 
display any items in thumbnail listings:

1. **atctListAlbum.py** - which is responsible for displaying items in 
   *atct_album_view.pt*
2. **thumbnail_view.pt** - which is the browser template responsible for 
   thumbnail listing for the *plone.app.collection* package

Installation
============

zc.buildout
-----------
If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Update your buildout.cfg file:

  * Add ``eea.depiction`` to the list of eggs to install
  * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug

  ::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      ...
      eea.depiction

    zcml =
      ...
      eea.depiction-overrides
      eea.depiction

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

  $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


How to specify fallback preview images
======================================
eea.depiction 0.3 introduces the concept of fallback images when the regular
image traversal fails. The logic works like this:

1. Look for an image returned by the contexts 'imgview' adapter
2. If the imgview crashes, isn't found or can not locate/generate an image,
   we continue by checking if there's an image specified for any of the
   contexts interfaces.
3. If there's no fallback image, we look for an image for the context
   portal type, e.g. article, news-item, document. This should be placed
   in the 'portal_depiction' utility (Site Setup > Depiction Library)
4. Uses the generic content type image, i.e. portal_depiction/generic

Thus:

1. To map a fallback image to a portal type, place it in this folder and name
   it after the portal type.
2. To map a fallback image to an interface just add a named-utility for
   IDepictionVocabulary (see eea.depiction.vocabularies)


Dependencies
============

`EEA Depiction`_ has the following dependencies:
  - Plone 4+
  - Pillow

This package also supports p4a.video. Thus the following dependencies are optional:
  - p4a.video

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      ...
      eea.depiction [full]
