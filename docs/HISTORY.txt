8.2 - (2020-01-15)
---------------------------
* Feature: added ability to provide a fallback image for a specific scale name
  for example if we want to have a different fallback image for the large scale
  of a Document we can add an image with the id *document-large* and for
  image_large this image will be used instead of the Document fallback image
  or any given generic image if no image is added for Document in general.
  Through acquisition you can also override the served image if you add an
  image with id *document-large* within a parent container.
