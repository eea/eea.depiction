===================
ATField integration
===================

First we set up a newsitem test content with archetypes.

  >>> self.setRoles(['Manager'])
  >>> id = portal.invokeFactory('News Item', id='newsitem')
  >>> newsitem = portal[id]

News items has an image field attribute. This is what the default ImageView looks for.
We don't have to configure anything. If we make a request for the thumb image scale, the
machinery will take care of everything.

  >>> newsitem.setImage(img)
  >>> newsitem.restrictedTraverse('image_thumb')
  <Image at ...>
